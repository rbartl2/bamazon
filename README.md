# Bamazon!

## Description

Welcome to bamazon, an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Inquirer. This project prompts users to input their desired item id and quantity. The user will be notified of the cost of the purchase, and the SQL database will be updated with up-to-date quantities.

## How does it work?

Begin by opening the terminal
1. In the command line, type: `node bamazonCustomer.js`
2. A table containing all available products will appear
3. When prompted, enter the intended item id
4. Enter the quantity desired
5. User will be notified of the cost of purchase and the table and database will reflect the new quantity
